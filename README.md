## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure Firebase services. Follow the steps below:

Create a Firebase project at https://firebase.google.com if you haven't already.
- Enable Firebase Authentication.
- Obtain the Firebase configuration object from the Firebase console.
- Update the Firebase configuration in the project code.
- Create a folder "config" with file firebase.ts and replace the following lines with your Firebase configuration:

```bash
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth'

const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "",
    authDomain: "",
    projectId: "",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: "",
    appId: ""
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);


```
    

## Deployment

## UI Libraries

- **<a href="https://mui.com/" target="_blank">MUI</a>**: A customizable UI library for React.js that provides various UI components.

## Problem Approach
- Carefully examined the project requirements to determine the unique functionalities needed for each application.
- Conducted comprehensive research to assess various technologies and frameworks, considering factors like cross-platform compatibility performance, and developer-friendliness.
- Established the development environment by configuring essential tools, libraries, and dependencies.
- Adopted a modular architecture pattern to promote the separation of code into reusable components, which facilitates better separation of concerns and more efficient testing.
- Leveraged Git for collaborative development, efficient code management, and precise tracking of changes.

## If time was infinite
 Given infinite time, here are some exciting features I would add to enhance the user experience:
- Create playlist option: Implement a feature that allows users to create and manage playlists.
- Artist Page:: Design a dedicated artist page where users can explore and learn more about their favorite musicians.
- Like Song Functionality: Enable users to like and save their preferred songs with a simple "like" button.
